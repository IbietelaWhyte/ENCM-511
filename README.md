# ENCM-511
Embedded Systems Interfacing.

In this class, we learnt how to read and write from general input and output registers of the analog Devices' Blackfin microcontroller.
We used these lessons in many applications like the coffeepot simulator where the switches and LEDs are used to control a virtual coffeepot.

We also learnt other features of blackfin like the interrupt handling using the general purpose timers, the watchdog timer and the coretimer. We learnt how to build programs around interrupts and how to use them in our projects like using the general purpose timers to read the temperature in a room and displaying that temperature on an LCD Screen using an SPI interface. All of these were done using test driven development methodology
