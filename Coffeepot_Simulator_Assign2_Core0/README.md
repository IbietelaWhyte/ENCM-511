THIS PROJECT INVOLVES USING THE FRONTPANEL SWITCHES TO CONTROL AN IMAGINARY COFFEEPOT WITH FEATURES LIKE TURN ON, TURN OFF, ADD WATER, 
ADD HEAT, ADD COFFEEPOD

THE COFFEEPOT AUTOMATICALLY ADDS WATER WHEN THE WATER HAS EVAPORATED PAST A CERTAIN LEVEL AND THE HEAT AUTOMATICALLY TURNS OFF ONCE A 
CERTAIN TEMPERATURE IS REACHED

THE VALUES OF REGISTERS FOR THE COFFEPOT ARE DISPLAYED ON THE FRONTPANEL LEDS INDICATING WHAT CONTROL IS BEING USED
